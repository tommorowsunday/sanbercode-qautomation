# @rpii/wdio-report-events

### Updated for module compatibility with webdriver 8

Abstracts the event driver messaging to pass screenshots and log data to webdriverio reports

Used internally by various packages that need to fire events, and listen for them.  

Easy to update if webdriver.io changes the report scheme again.
